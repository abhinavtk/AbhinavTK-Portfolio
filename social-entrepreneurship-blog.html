            <p>Social entrepreneurship is emerging as an innovative approach for dealing with complex social needs.
                Social entrepreneurship may call for quite different standards of evaluation when compared with standard
                forms of entrepreneurship. Social enterprise as an activity is commonly equated with social
                entrepreneurship.
            </p>
            <p>
                A social entrepreneur will simply be someone who organizes and/or operates a venture or corporation,
                which features social goals. The key to social enterprise involves taking a business-like, innovative
                approach to the mission of delivering community services.
                Developing new social enterprise business ventures is only one facet of social entrepreneurship. Another
                facet is maximizing revenue generation from programs by applying principles from for-profit business
                without neglecting the core mission.
            </p>
            <p>
                Social entrepreneurship is exercised where some person or group: <ol>
                    <li>aims at creating social value, either exclusively or at least in some prominent way;</li>
                    <li> show a capacity to recognize and take advantage of opportunities to create that value;</li>
                    <li> employ innovation, ranging from outright invention to adapting someone else’s novelty, in
                        creating and/or distributing social value;</li>
                    <li> is/are willing to accept an above-average degree of risk in creating and disseminating social
                        value; and</li>
                    <li> is/are unusually resourceful in being relatively undaunted by scarce assets in pursuing their
                        social venture.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                Social entrepreneurs and their undertakings are driven by social goals; that is, the desire to benefit
                society in some way or ways. This is another way of saying that the social entrepreneur aims in some way
                to increase ‘‘social value,’’ i.e. to contribute to the welfare or well being in a given human
                community. Disagreement takes place over the location social goals must have in the purposes of the
                entrepreneur or his/her undertaking.
</p>
<p>
                For an entrepreneur, the value proposition anticipates and is organized to serve markets that can
                comfortably afford the new product or service, and is thus designed to create financial profit. From the
                outset, the expectation is that the entrepreneur and his or her investors will derive some personal
                financial gain. The social entrepreneur, however, neither anticipates nor organizes to create
                substantial financial profit for his or her investors or for himself or herself. Instead, the social
                entrepreneur aims for value in the form of large-scale, transformational benefit that accrues either to
                a significant segment of society or to society at large. This is the basic difference between a normal
                entrepreneur and a social entrepreneur.
</p>
<p>
                But interest in social entrepreneurship transcends the phenomenon of popularity and fascination with
                people. Social entrepreneurship signals the imperative to drive social change, and it is that potential
                payoff, with its lasting, transformational benefit to society, that sets the field and its practitioners
                apart. A clearer definition of social entrepreneurship will aid the development of the field. The social
                entrepreneur should be understood as someone who targets an unfortunate but stable equilibrium that
                causes the neglect, marginalization, or suffering of a segment of humanity; who brings to bear on this
                situation his or her inspiration, direct action, creativity, courage, and fortitude; and who aims for
                and ultimately affects the establishment of a new stable equilibrium that secures permanent benefit for
                the targeted group and society at large.
