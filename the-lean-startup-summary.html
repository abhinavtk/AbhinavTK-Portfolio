            <p>The Lean Startup by Eric Ries is an influential book in the startup ecosystem. The book has helped many
                startups to become big businesses by applying the lessons and principles of the book. Eric Ries being a
                co-founder and worked at chief managerial positions at various startups has written this book based on
                real-world experiences. The book can be structured into 3 sections namely, Vision, Steer and Accelerate.
            </p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The inspiration for the Lean Startup model has to be attributed to the Toyota manufacturing revolution.
                They made Toyota into a multinational company by implementing the following principles:
                <ul>
                    <li>Leveraging the knowledge and skills of individuals in the company.</li>
                    <li>Reducing batch sizes.</li>
                    <li>Make use of just-in-time production and managing inventory.</li>
                    <li>Accelerated cycle times.</li>
                </ul>
                This model showed the importance of value-generating behaviour, which is one of the core principles of
                the Lean Startup model. The author, therefore, says that a startup becomes successful by having the
                right execution, that is to follow the right process and not that of having a great idea or delivering
                the product at the right time. Hence the Lean Startup model is based on the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast cycle times.</li>
                    <li>Focus on what the customer wants.</li>
                    <li>Using scientific and statistical approach for decision making.</li>
                </ul>
                The lean startup business model is hence a new approach for developing new products in innovative ways
                like speedy iterations, customer insights, creative vision and ambitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of <b>validated learning</b> is introduced in the book. This concept is a quick and accurate
                way of startup planning and market forecasting. The
                book talks about the online store Zappos in this regard as an example and how it was founded by Nick
                Swinmurn. Nick first approached shoe stores and took photos of their inventories and posted them online.
                And if people showed interest in buying those products he went to the store and bought it and sent it to
                them. This approach was to check whether there was a demand for shoes online. This was a quicker and
                more reliable way of finding out the demand of a business rather than methods like customer survey and
                market hypothesis.
                Hence validated learning and fast experimentation are very important steps in the Lean startup business
                model. When the first iteration of our product is launched and distributed we get the knowledge of the
                customer behaviour and expectations as well as a lot of valuable data regarding the reality of the
                business.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Steer</h2>
                <b>Minimum viability product (MVP)</b> is a version of our new product introduced into the market with
                only the basic features but gets enough attraction from the customers. It helps to get the maximum
                amount of validated learning about the customers as fast as possible. The lean startup model depends on
                minimum viable products. Successful companies like Zappos, Dropbox, twitter, etc. are examples of MVPs.
                They are the best way for <b>Build-Measure-Learn</b> feedback loop. Build-Measure-Learn is the typical
                way in which a startup develop. A product is first released into the real world, then its success is
                measured and with this real data the direction of the product for the next stage is determined through
                validated learning. MVPs can be anything from an advertisement to a prototype. An MVP is only the first step towards building a better and highly motivated
                product according to the Lean Startup model. Also the MVPs can more often give a negative feedback from
                the customers since it lacks all of the functionalities of a product. But the need for an MVP is to get
                the valuable customer data for validated learning and for Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. We should
                consider it as an input for our next iteration and use it for further innovations in the product. MVP is
                just the first step of our startup journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Measuring success and failures should be optimal as far as a lean startup is considered. Instead of
                setting milestones or getting ratings from a few customers as a metric for measuring growth, we should
                have other optimal metrics for measuring success. Two tools for measuring success is introduced in this
                book: <b>innovation accounting</b> and <b>actionable metrics.</b></p>
            <p>
                In innovation accounting startups proves the usage of validated learning to develop a startup. In this
                model startups deliver an MVP to get data on the status of the product. This MVP which gives the
                customer behaviour, is a real life data for our product’s next step. Every startup should focus towards
                their ideal objective. Every situation should be focused on reaching that objective. They should be a
                growth driver. For example if we consider customer activation as a growth parameter, some iteration
                should focus on improving the user experience on our product- like user interface of an app, smooth
                onboarding while getting introduced to our service, etc. If such iterations doesn’t increase our
                customer size, then we should consider it as a failure.
                We should always be ready to choose whether to persevere on our process or pivot to a new direction. If
                the drivers are not directing towards achieving our baselines, then it is an indication to pivot. </p>
            <p>
                <b>Actionable metrics</b> is another way startups should measure their success. There are 3 A’s which
                actionable metrics should follow:
                <ol>
                    <li>Actionable: A data report is actionable if it indicates clear results, that is, whether a step
                        is a success or a failure.</li>
                    <li>Accessible: The data reports have to be simple and understandable and very much accessible so
                        that everyone can use them as a source to make further decisions.</li>
                    <li>Auditable: The data reports should have only the true stats which shows the real customer
                        behaviour and interactions.</li>
                </ol>
                As we discussed already a very important decision we have to make at any point is whether to pivot or
                continue persevering. Even though perseverance is a wonderful quality, for an entrepreneur as far as
                running a business is concerned, holding onto a failing business after showing too many red flags can be
                a bad idea. A well-planned pivot in another direction can be helpful to a failing startup to redirect
                into a successful path.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>Accelerate</h2>
                Working with smaller batches is more efficient than larger ones since we can identify and rectify
                problems much faster and can save a good amount of money and time in that case. The problem with dealing
                with large batches is that they have to spend more time while releasing each iteration and this is
                against the principle of less wasting time that a Lean startup has to thoroughly follow. However
                switching to a smaller batch may feel inefficient if you are a more traditional manager.
                In the lean startup model, we formulate a hypothesis and deliver an MVP to the market using a small
                batch in a quicker time. Large batches have the problem of taking more time in our Build-Measure-Learn
                feedback loop and the validated learning process. Small batches also imply smaller workspaces and
                inventories which helps to free a good amount of warehouse space.
                Sustainable growth in a lean startup model is achieved by getting new customers from the activities of
                old customers. This can be achieved through the following ways:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Word of mouth:</b> This is due to the customers being greatly satisfied with our product
                        which results in our product being recommended by them to others.</li>
                    <li><b>For co-usage of product:</b> This means a product is suggested by a friend so that they can
                        use them together. For example apps like Google Pay is recommended by a friend so that he can
                        send money online.</li>
                    <li><b>Repeated purchase:</b> Services like netflix where there is a subscription plan so the
                        satisfied customers will keep on renewing their subscriptions.</li>
                </ul>
                These sustainable growth forms are helpful for different feedback loops refereed to as <b>“engines of
                    growth”.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The age-old problem that employees should work harder to increase productivities should be replaced by a
                system where employees adopts the Lean startup business method where all assumptions are stated and
                tested. Speed and quality will increase our value towards the customers. Failures will help us learn
                and speed will prevent unwanted work.
                The bootomline is that the Lean Startups are models that use continuous innovation to create radically
                successful businesses.
