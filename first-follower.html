                For any movement to be successful, the first follower is as important as the leader himself. It is in
                fact an under-appreciated form of leadership. As the narrator says in the video, the first follower is
                the one who turns a nut into a leader. He is the one who can start the momentum and turn the movement to
                reality. The first follower is the one who can add more followers to the movement because he can show
                others how to follow and why following the leader is not a bad idea. What the video essentially tries to
                tell is that ‘following’ is a leadership quality in itself. If someone wants to be a true leader, he
                should first learn how to follow. As far as a leader or beginner of a movement is concerned, he should
                treat the first follower as equal and show him the importance of the movement. He should make the first
                follower believe the same way he does. As a leader the most important thing is to gather the first few
                members because if they are good they will take care of building the rest of the team.

                In an entrepreneur’s point of view, when one starts something, the first few members of the team are
                very crucial. They should have the same values and principles as that of the founder and they should
                consider the idea and the startup as their own. They should believe the same way the founder does. The
                first members of the team should have the courage to stand alone and the guts to get ridiculed. The
                first follower is like the first mate in a ship who is the most important person after the captain and
                the captain can count on him whenever he is not around.
